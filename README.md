# Autonomous Car 2022 -MLIS II-

Hi mate, I have completed the first try. You can check the "MLiS-AutonomousCar_Project.ipynb" file for now. Results look good, but probably there is something wrong. :) Because I didn't do much image process so far but the good thing is, we can now build other things on that code.

I don't use kaggle before so, don't know how to send result to there but for now i'think that's not a big deal. I'll learn soon :)
