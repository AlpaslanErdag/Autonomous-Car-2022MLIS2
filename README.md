# Autonomous Car 2022 -MLIS II-

Hi mate, I have completed the first try. You can check the "MLiS-AutonomousCar_Project.ipynb" file for now. Results look good, but probably there is something wrong. :) Because I didn't do much image process so far but the good thing is, we can now build other things on that code.

I don't use kaggle before so, don't know how to send result to there but for now i'think that's not a big deal. I'll learn soon :)

I have some concerns about data as well. For example all the "angle" data has positive value. It seems odd to me. I mean it's like when the algorithm uses this data, it learns that the vehicle only turns in one direction.(left or right) It's possible to fix this with some image processing techniques, but I'm thinking of asking Adam as well.
